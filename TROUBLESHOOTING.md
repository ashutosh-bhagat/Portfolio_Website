# ðŸ”§ Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## ðŸš¨ 404 Error Fix

If you're getting a 404 NOT_FOUND error after deployment, try these solutions:

### âœ… Solution 1: Check Build Output

1. Run `npm run build` locally
2. Verify files exist in `public/`, `dist/`, and `_static/` directories
3. Make sure `index.html` is in the output directory

### âœ… Solution 2: Try Different Output Directories

Replace your `vercel.json` with:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist"
}
```

Or try:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "_static"
}
```

### âœ… Solution 3: Manual Deployment

1. Delete your current Vercel project
2. Create a new deployment
3. When asked for build settings, use:
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `public`
   - **Install Command**: `npm install`

### âœ… Solution 4: Framework Detection Override

In Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to Project Settings
2. Set Framework Preset to "Other"
3. Set Build Command to `npm run build`
4. Set Output Directory to `public`

### âœ… Solution 5: Root Directory Deployment

If all else fails, you can deploy from the root directory:

1. Copy files to root: `cp public/* ./`
2. Set Output Directory to `./` (root)

### ðŸ”„ Redeploy Steps
